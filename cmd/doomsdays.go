	Conway's method for finding the day of week for any given year

	1. Figure out the modifier for the given century (the four centuries repeat, so 1700-1799 = 2100-2199):
		- 1800 - 1899: 5
		- 1900 - 1999: 3
		- 2000 - 2099: 2
		- 2100 - 2199: 0

	2. Divide the year (without the century) by 12
	3. Figure out the remainder from step 2
	4. Divide the answer from step 3 by 4 and ignore the remainder
	5. Add the results from steps 1, 2, 3, 4.
	6. Mod the result of step 5 by 7
	7. The answer from step 6 gives the day of the week that Doomsday falls on
		- 0 = Sunday
		- 1 = Monday
		- 2 = Tuesday
		- 3 = Wednesday
		- 4 = Thursday
		- 5 = Friday
		- 6 = Saturday
