Conway's method for finding the day of week for any given year

1. Figure out the modifier for the given century (the four centuries repeat, so 1700-1799 = 2100-2199):
	- 1800 - 1899: 5
	- 1900 - 1999: 3
	- 2000 - 2099: 2
	- 2100 - 2199: 0

2. Divide the year (without the century) by 12
3. Figure out the remainder from step 2
4. Divide the answer from step 3 by 4 and ignore the remainder
5. Add the results from steps 1, 2, 3, 4.
6. Mod the result of step 5 by 7
7. The answer from step 6 gives the day of the week that Doomsday falls on
	- 0 = Sunday
	- 1 = Monday
	- 2 = Tuesday
	- 3 = Wednesday
	- 4 = Thursday
	- 5 = Friday
	- 6 = Saturday

 8. Find the date you want relative to the doomsday in a given month
 	- January = 3 or 4 (leap year)
 	- February = the last day of February
	- March 7th
 	- April 4th
 	- May 9th
 	- June 6th
 	- July 11th
 	- August 8th
 	- September 5th
 	- October 10th
 	- November 7th
 	- December 12th`,
